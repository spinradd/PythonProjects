BlackJack!


Go easy on me. This file was made at the beginning of my python journey. I made it all using functions, I should have waited for the day on classes...

This game has some pretty cool features that give it the statistical same feel as you would play in a casino!

The deck you play from has 5 decks total inside of it, with automatic reshuffling at 50%. Of course, you can restock and reshuffle the deck again after any hand.

A splitting functionality makes any pair exciting! If chosen to split you will automatically bet double you initial bet.

Other than that, the rules are the same!
