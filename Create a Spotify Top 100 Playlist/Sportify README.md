# Spotify top 100 playlists!

This program will search the billboards top 100 songs for a particular date of your choosing.

Next, it will create a spotify playlist under your account that contains these 100 songs.

In order to execute this code, you will need to set up a spotify developers account, and gather the necessary OAuth information and input into the "main" file.

This set up takes several minutes and some troubleshooting, but the results are very cool!
