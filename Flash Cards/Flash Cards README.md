# Flash Cards!
_all files and folders should be places in the same level of your directory_

This program utilizes csv files to store foreign words and their translations.

Feel free to replace these contents with any language you choose.



The "german_words" file should contain two columns of data:
    - the first of the foreign language
    - the second with its translation
    
The "learn_german" file will be created automatically, but they will house the words that you have not yet mastered, or "got wrong" while using the flash card application.

The "mastered_german_words" file contains words that you have successfully translated while using the app. If you select the green or "mastered" button while using the app,
then these words will be taken out of circulation.

The app will ask you if you want to clear the mastered list and reset the "learn_german" list at every startup.
If you choose no, the list will remain the same as they were at the last session.



Enjoy!
