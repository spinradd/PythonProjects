# LinkedIn Auto Apply

This program will automatically apply to jobs from a specified LinkedIn job boards search! 

The program will log you into LinkedIn and look up a url you specify that will load a page of jobs.

The script will then auto apply you to all the jobs that are loaded onto this list, if they have an "Easy Apply" option.

You will need to enter in your username, password, and phone number as well as the url link into the "main" file.

You will need the selenium application.
