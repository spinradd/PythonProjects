# Pong


This is _the_ classic arcade game.

There is no AI, so you will need two players to play an actual match.

Player one uses **w**, and **s** to move the paddle. Player two uses the **up** and **down** arrow keys.

The game ends at a score of 3.

The ball has similiar properties to the pong you know and love!
