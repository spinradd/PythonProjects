# Weather Notification

This program utilizes twilio to send you a text based on your local weather.

A few things. Be sure to enter in your personal lattitude and longitude, as well as your personal phone number in the "main" file.
Also, you will need to set up a twilio account. You'll need your twilio verified number, your twilio client ID, and your secret ID.

Also, the time returned from the API is UTC, so you will need to convert the time should you have a different timezone.
