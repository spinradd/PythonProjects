# Workout Tracker

This program utilize the trackapi.nutrients API and the sheety API to automatically keep track of exercises you complete.

You will need an API key as well as a sheety account and google sheet url to store your results.

The program asks you to enter in a complete sentence of a workout you just performed. After input, the script will send your 
setence to the workout API where it will be broken down into the activity, the duration, and the calories burned. This information will then be transplanted into
a google sheet of your choice from your sheety url.
